Docker Best Practices

Use Official and Verified Images
---------------------------------
Official Images: Start with official images from Docker Hub when possible, as they are maintained and updated regularly.
Minimal Base Images: Use minimal base images (like alpine) to reduce the attack surface and image size.

2. Keep Images Small
----------------------
Multi-Stage Builds: Use multi-stage builds to minimize the final image size by only including necessary components.
Remove Unnecessary Files: Clean up package lists, cache files, and other unnecessary files to keep the image lean.

3. Tag Images Properly
-----------------------
Version Tagging: Tag images with version numbers (e.g., myapp:1.0) instead of just using latest to avoid ambiguity and ensure consistency across deployments.

4. Manage Secrets Securely
---------------------------
Environment Variables: Avoid hardcoding secrets in your Dockerfile or image. Use environment variables or Docker secrets for sensitive information.
Docker Secrets: Utilize Docker Swarm or Kubernetes secrets management for secure storage and usage of sensitive data.

5. Use Dockerignore
---------------------
.dockerignore File: Include a .dockerignore file to prevent unnecessary files and directories from being added to the build context, speeding up the build process and keeping the image clean.

6. Run as Non-Root User
--------------------------
Non-Root User: Create and run containers with a non-root user to improve security. You can add a user in the Dockerfile using RUN useradd -m myuser and switch to that user with USER myuser.

7. Optimize Layer Caching
---------------------------
Layer Order: Order your Dockerfile instructions to maximize layer caching. Frequently changing commands should be at the end of the Dockerfile.
Combine Commands: Combine commands where possible to reduce the number of layers, but balance it with readability.
